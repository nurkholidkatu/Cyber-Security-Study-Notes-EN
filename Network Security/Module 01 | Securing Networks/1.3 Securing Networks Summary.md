# Securing Networks Summary

This module reinforced the critical importance of **network security** in today's digital landscape and provided an overview of how to protect different network environments.

## The High Stakes of Network Security
Network security is not just an **IT issue**; it is directly tied to **business continuity**.  
A security breach can halt e-commerce, lead to theft of sensitive data, compromise personal privacy, and damage a company's reputation.  

The consequences are severe, including **financial loss, intellectual property theft, legal action, and risks to public safety**.  
To combat this, professionals use tools from groups like the **Cisco Talos Intelligence Group** to identify and mitigate threats.  

### Key Concept: Attack Vector
An attack vector is the **path a hacker uses** to enter a network.  
Threats can come from both **inside** and **outside** the organization.  

Since **data is the most valuable asset**, protecting it requires **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** strategies.  
Common data leakage methods include:
- Email  
- Social media  
- Unencrypted devices  
- Cloud storage  
- Improper access controls

## A Tour of Network Topologies and Their Defenses

### Campus Area Networks (CANs)
Campus networks use a **defense-in-depth** strategy, layering security with:
- VPNs  
- ASA Firewalls  
- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)  
- Secure Layer 2 & 3 switches  

### Small Office/Home Office (SOHO)
SOHO networks are typically secured by **all-in-one consumer-grade routers**, which provide:
- Firewall  
- WPA2 encryption for wireless connections  

### Wide Area Networks (WANs)
WANs secure **data traveling over long distances** by using:
- Dedicated security appliances  
- Firewalls at the networkâ€™s edge  

### Data Centers
Data centers require **extreme physical security**, consisting of:
- **Outside perimeter**: fences, gates  
- **Inside perimeter**: biometrics, mantraps (security airlocks)  

### Cloud Networks
Cloud networks rely on **virtualization** to run multiple VMs on a single server.  
This introduces new risks such as:
- Hyperjacking  
- Antivirus Storms  

Solutions include the **Cisco Secure Data Center**, which provides:
- Segmentation  
- Threat defense  
- Visibility

## The Evolving Border
The **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** trend has blurred the traditional network border.  
To address this, **Borderless Networks** use **Mobile Device Management (MDM)** to:
- Secure personal devices  
- Control access to corporate resources
