# Current State of Affairs  

## 1.1.1 Networks Are Targets  
<p align="justify">
Modern networks are constantly under attack. News reports frequently highlight organizations that have been compromised, exposing the serious risks faced by digital infrastructures. A quick search on the internet will reveal numerous articles about network breaches, the latest threats, and the defensive tools available to counter them.

## 1.1.2 Reasons for Network Security  
<p align="justify">
Network security is directly tied to an organization’s business continuity. Breaches can disrupt online services, cause the loss of sensitive information, compromise user privacy, and threaten the overall integrity of systems. Such incidents often lead to financial losses, intellectual property theft, lawsuits, and in some cases, even risks to public safety.
</p>  

<p align="justify">
Maintaining strong security ensures the protection of network users and the safeguarding of business interests. Security professionals must stay vigilant against emerging threats, evolving attack methods, and newly discovered vulnerabilities in devices and applications.
</p>  

<p align="justify">
Many resources and intelligence platforms are available to assist administrators in developing effective mitigation techniques, monitoring threats, and responding quickly to vulnerabilities.

## 1.1.3 Vectors of Network Attacks  
<p align="justify">
An attack vector refers to the path or means by which a threat actor gains access to a server, host, or network. These vectors can originate externally or internally. For example, external attackers may attempt to disrupt operations through denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, while internal users may exploit their access to damage or steal information.
</p>  

<p align="justify">
External threats typically come from the internet, attempting to bypass firewalls or exploit vulnerabilities. Internal threats, however, can be more damaging, as employees or insiders may have direct knowledge of the network infrastructure and easier access to sensitive systems. Internal risks include:
</p>  

- Stealing and copying confidential data onto removable devices or through email.  
- Compromising internal servers or networking devices.  
- Disrupting network availability by disconnecting critical systems.  
- Introducing malware via infected USB drives or other media.  

<p align="justify">
Both internal and external threats must be addressed through strong policies, monitoring, and technical controls.

## 1.1.4 Data Loss  
<p align="justify">
Data is one of the most valuable assets for any organization. It may include research and development information, sales and financial records, employee and customer details, and legal documentation. Data loss—whether intentional or accidental—occurs when sensitive information is stolen, leaked, or exposed to unauthorized parties.
</p>  

<p align="justify">
The consequences of data loss can be severe, including:
</p>  

- Damage to reputation and brand image.  
- Loss of competitive advantage.  
- Decreased customer trust and loyalty.  
- Financial loss and reduced revenue.  
- Legal actions, fines, and penalties.  
- High costs associated with recovery and notification of affected parties.  

<p align="justify">
To address these risks, organizations must adopt Data Loss Prevention (DLP) strategies. These include a combination of technical measures, operational practices, and strategic policies to reduce the risk of sensitive information being compromised.
